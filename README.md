# Feddit

## Description
Feddit is a minimalistic web app that is all about delicious food. See Reddit posts of meals or desserts, whatever your mood is. Feddit is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with the help of React, and is my first personal project that communicates with a third party API.

## Features
 * **Responsive:** Optimized for devices as small as the 4.7" iPhone SE. Images are scaled to be easy to view for any screen size.
 * **Easy to use:** Click on the feed buttons to easily switch categories. A persistent search bar allows you to search for a food item whenever you want. Need to go to the top? Just tap on the feed buttons.
 * **Displays the essentials:** See a Reddit post's score and comments right from Feddit. Simply tap on any image, and you'll see its full resolution version pop up.

## Possible Future Work
* Allow upvoting/downvoting directly from Feddit
* Have the ability to fetch more posts from Feddit when a user scrolls to the very bottom.
* Format comments that have markdown so that they look better
* Load comments in chunks at a time/ in the background so that it doesn't take forever to view comments
* Have some form of comment control
* Get posts from more than two reddit communities

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
